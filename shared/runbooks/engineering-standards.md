# Engineering Standards — codeiq

> **SSoT** for the cross-cutting engineering rules that every contributor — human or agent — must follow on this repo. Per-issue specifics live in the issue thread; per-component conventions live in [`/CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md). This document is what the runbooks ([`release.md`](release.md), [`rollback.md`](rollback.md), [`first-time-setup.md`](first-time-setup.md)) reference for "what counts as done."

The rule of last resort: **`/home/dev/.claude/rules/*.md` wins.** This file does not contradict it; it specialises it for codeiq.

## 1. Quality gates (hard / non-negotiable)

| Gate | Threshold | Where it runs | Failure action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit + integration tests | All pass | `mvn verify` (CI + local) | Block merge |
| JaCoCo coverage | ≥ 85% line, ≥ 75% branch (project-wide, post-exclusions) | `jacoco-maven-plugin` rule in `pom.xml` | Block merge |
| SonarCloud Quality Gate | `Passed` (`Sonar way` profile + 80% new-code coverage) | `ci-java.yml` | Block merge |
| SpotBugs | Zero High/Critical findings; `spotbugs-exclude.xml` justified per-entry | `mvn spotbugs:check` | Block merge |
| OWASP Dependency-Check | No High/Critical CVEs (`failBuildOnCVSS=7`); Medium tracked | `mvn dependency-check:check` (CI nightly + on `release-java.yml`) | Block release |
| OSV-Scanner | Clean, or every finding has a justification commit on file | weekly cron + on PR | Block release on High/Critical |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Best-effort; no hard score floor; `Pinned-Dependencies` is a soft target | `scorecard.yml` (push to `main` + weekly) | Surface in security tab; do **not** gate merge |
| Signed commits | Every commit on `main` must verify | Branch protection + `gh api ... /commits/{sha}/check-runs` | Block merge |

Coverage exclusions are enumerated in `pom.xml` `<jacoco>` config — only generated ANTLR sources, the `application/` Spring Boot main, and pure data records are excluded. Adding to that list requires TechLead sign-off.

## 2. Code style

- **Java 25** — virtual threads, records, sealed types, pattern matching are first-class. Do not write defensive `instanceof` chains where pattern matching applies.
- **No mutable state in detectors.** `@Component` beans are singletons; per-call state lives on method locals.
- **UTF-8 everywhere** (`StandardCharsets.UTF_8` explicit, never the default).
- **Determinism is enforced.** No `Set` iteration without `TreeSet`/`stream().sorted()`. No reliance on thread completion order. Every detector must have a determinism test (run twice → identical bytes).
- **Property-key constants** — extract any string literal that appears in the same file 3+ times.
- **Exception hygiene** — never catch `Exception` to hide it; always either rethrow with context or log at the right level.

Formatting is handled by editor defaults (no auto-formatter committed). Reviewers will not nit on whitespace; they will block on convention drift.

---

## 3. Branch, commit, PR rules

- Branch off `main`. Conventional-commit subjects (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `perf:`).
- One logical change per commit. Squash-merge is the only path into `main`.
- Every commit ssh-signed (RAN-46 AC #2). Branch protection rejects unsigned commits.
- PR title is a conventional-commit subject. Body contains:
  - Linked Paperclip issue (e.g., `Closes RAN-42`).
  - "Why" in 1–2 sentences (the diff covers "what").
  - Tests / coverage notes if non-obvious.
  - Rollback note if the change is risky.
- No force-push to `main` ever. Force-push to feature branches is fine until the PR is open; once it is open, prefer additive commits so review threads stay anchored.

---

## 4. Testing tiers

| Tier | What it tests | Where it lives | Speed budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Pure logic, no I/O | `src/test/java/.../<package>` next to the SUT | < 10 ms each |
| Integration | Real H2 / real Neo4j (Embedded) / real filesystem | `src/test/java/.../analyzer/`, `.../graph/`, `.../e2e/` | < 5 s each |
| E2E quality | Full pipeline against a real repo (Spring PetClinic, etc.) | `E2EQualityTest`, ground-truth files under `src/test/resources/e2e/` | Run on demand + nightly |

Ground rules:
- Test behaviour at the boundary; do not test private internals.
- Every detector ships with: a positive case, a discriminator-guard negative case, a determinism case.
- Flaky test = broken test. Fix in the same PR, quarantine with a tracked Paperclip issue, or delete.

---

## 5. Security

- **Inputs** — every public-facing endpoint validates input at the boundary; parameterised queries only; output encoded by default.
- **Path traversal** — anything that takes a user path goes through the canonical-path check pattern used by `/api/file` (see RAN-8 fix).
- **Secrets** — never in code, config, or commit history. CI secrets are repo-level; rotation cadence is annual or on suspected exposure.
- **CVE policy** — High/Critical → block; Medium → fix if a patched version exists, else document non-exploitability with TechLead sign-off; Low → tracked in the next dependency bump cycle.
- **Vulnerability reporting** — see [`/SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md). Private disclosure only.

---

## 6. Performance

- Default to streaming and bounded concurrency. No unbounded queues, buffers, or virtual-thread fan-outs.
- Every external call has a timeout and a cancellation path.
- Performance-sensitive paths (`Analyzer`, `GraphStore.bulkSave`, `LayerClassifier`) have a microbenchmark or a regression-detection test before they ship.
- "Make it correct, then make it fast" — but data-structure and query-shape decisions must be performance-aware up front (see `/home/dev/.claude/rules/performance.md`).

---

## 7. Build & distribution

- Vendor what you can; deterministic builds (`mvn -B -ntp clean verify`) are the contract.
- No public-CDN runtime fetches, no auto-update phone-home, no telemetry default-on.
- GitHub Actions are pinned by commit SHA in every workflow. Rationale: OpenSSF Scorecard `Pinned-Dependencies` and supply-chain integrity.
- Container artifacts (when added) build from a minimal/distroless base, are pushed to GHCR with provenance attestations, and are pinned by digest at consumer sites.

---

## 8. Documentation

- `/CLAUDE.md` is the architecture + conventions SSoT for code-touching changes.
- `/AGENTS.md` (repo root) is the entry-point for agent collaborators.
- Every runbook lives under `shared/runbooks/`. Adding a new runbook requires updating this file's References section.
- ADRs (`docs/adr/NNN-title.md`) for any decision that changes a contract: persistence, public API surface, deployment shape.

---

## 9. References

- `/CLAUDE.md` — architecture and conventions.
- `/SECURITY.md` — disclosure policy.
- `shared/runbooks/release.md`, `rollback.md`, `first-time-setup.md`.
- `/home/dev/.claude/rules/*.md` — global engineering rules (parent SSoT).
- `pom.xml` — quality-gate plugin wiring (`jacoco`, `spotbugs`, `dependency-check`, `central-publishing`).
- `.github/workflows/` — CI / release / security automations.
- **CodeQL** — handled by GitHub repo-level **CodeQL default setup** (java-kotlin + javascript-typescript + actions), not a workflow file. A workflow-driven CodeQL was attempted in PR #74 and removed because GitHub rejects duplicate SARIF uploads when default setup is also enabled for the same language. Configuration lives under repo Settings → Code security → Code scanning.
